The Counter component in React allows users to increment and reset a five-digit counter, always displaying leading zeros. Key features include conditional opacity styling for zeros, smooth visual transitions, and a gradient background. Hover effects add a blurred shadow for visual appeal, providing a clear and responsive interface for tracking counts.

Leading Zero Formatting:

The counter value is formatted to always display five digits, with leading zeros as needed. For example, 5 is displayed as 00005.
<br/>
Conditional Styling:

The component uses conditional styling to adjust the opacity of digits based on their value. This helps to distinguish significant digits from insignificant zeros.
<br/>

Responsive Design:

The CSS styles are designed to ensure the counter and buttons are positioned correctly and responsively within the component. This includes using flexbox for alignment and positioning.
<br/>

User Interaction:

The component provides two buttons for user interaction:
A large, invisible button for incrementing the counter.
A small, invisible button for resetting the counter.
These buttons are positioned using absolute positioning for precise control over their placement.
<br/>

Visual Feedback:

The component includes visual feedback for user interactions:
The shadow effect on hover provides a visual cue that the counter is interactive.
The opacity change of digits provides immediate feedback on the counterâ€™s current value and highlights significant digits.
