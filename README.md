The Counter component in React allows users to increment and reset a five-digit counter, always displaying leading zeros. Key features include conditional opacity styling for zeros, smooth visual transitions, and a gradient background. Hover effects add a blurred shadow for visual appeal, providing a clear and responsive interface for tracking counts.
